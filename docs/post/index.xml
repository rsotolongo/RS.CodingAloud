      <description>Lately I have been involved in the creation of several NuGet packages useful for some portals being developed. I want to share my knowledge in this topic.
If we were developing libraries for .NET Core or .NET Standard life would be easy as figure 1 to figure 8 shows.
Figure 1: &amp;ldquo;Creating a new .NET Core library&amp;rdquo;.
Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Default code&amp;rdquo;.
Figure 3: &amp;ldquo;First build results&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Source code of support available at GitHub
Since while ago I wanted to share my experiences automatizing the product releases with Octopus from Visual Studio. Again, let’s do it through an example.
As it could not be otherwise, figure 1 shows the first package you should add to your project in order to create Octopus packages ready to be deployed: &amp;ldquo;OctoPack&amp;rdquo;. The latest package version available at the time of this tutorial was the &amp;ldquo;3.</description>

      <description>A colleague ask me to share my experience coding with ReSharper and once he heard that I’m not use ReSharper he was even more curious about how I write source codes. Who knows me knows I love NuGet packages and be updated constantly, that’s why I found a very useful package that I install in all my projects as soon I start it.
StyleCop.MSBuild
StyleCop used to be a standalone application with integration with Visual Studio but that changed a while ago.</description>

      <description>I officially welcome you to my professional blog, I will try to write frequently about development technologies, programming languages, data structures, algorithms, among other topics related to this incredible technological world, always expressing my personal opinions.
I decided to start thanks to the fact that I felt the urgent need to write after accumulating experience developing software and constantly explaining over and over again the concepts, approaches, and solutions applied; together with Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s recommendation to write an article about everything that cannot be explained in six sentences.</description>
