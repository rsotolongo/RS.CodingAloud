I officially welcome you to my professional blog, I will try to write frequently about development technologies, programming languages, data structures, algorithms, among other topics related to this incredible technological world, always expressing my personal opinions.

I decided to start thanks to the fact that I felt the urgent need to write after accumulating experience developing software and constantly explaining over and over again the concepts, approaches, and solutions applied; together with Scott Hanselman's recommendation to write an article about everything that cannot be explained in six sentences.

Most of the articles will also be translated into English. I hope to be of help to people who speak both languages.
